    <h1>Jake Tanis</h1>
    <p>I have been writing documentation for software since 2022. I put a lot of care and effort into understanding
        concepts so that I can communicate them to others in a helpful way. My philosophy behind technical writing
        includes learning the technical components of a concept and how it affects people, so that my writing of the
        concept serves as a bridge between groups who have a hard time understanding eachother.
