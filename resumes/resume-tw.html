        <h1>Jake Tanis</h1>
        <p>I have been writing documentation for technology since 2022. I put a lot of care and effort into understanding
            concepts so that I can communicate them to others in a helpful way. My philosophy behind technical writing
            includes learning the technical components of a product and how it affects people, so that my writing of the
            concept serves as a bridge for those who don't know the product's technicalities. 
        </p>
