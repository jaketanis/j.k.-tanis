What is technical writing?

I get these questions a lot, and so does probably every technical writer ever lived. The 'go to' answer sounds along the lines of 'someone who turns complex information into something understandable'or 'a writer that helps others perform a task', which are all true statements. But I don't think those same statements honor these questions well.

Technical writers were first needed because of the technological complexities developed during the world wars. Afer the wars, technical communication became a more organized field. Now there are tech writers that document many things.  

That is why the field exists now and why you can get paid for doing technical writing. But; technical writing itself goes far further than the mid 1900s, and it is much more interesting.
