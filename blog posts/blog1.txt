#My philosophy for technical communication

What is technical communication? What is technical writing? 

I get these questions a lot, and so does probably every technical writer ever lived. The 'go to' answer sounds along the lines of 'turning complex information into something understandable'or 'writing that helps others perform a task', which are all true statements. But I don't think those same statements honor these questions well.
