        <h1>What is technical writing?</h1>
            <p>October 8, 2024</p>
            <p>What is technical writing?</p>
            <p>I get this question whenever I tell people what I do
            (unsurprisingly), and so does probably every technical
            writer. The go to answer sounds along the lines of ‘someone
            who turns complex information into something understandable’
            or ‘a writer that helps others perform a task’. But I don’t
            think those statements honor these questions well.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the aim of technical writing is to write in a
            way that teaches. They do this by: 1. Knowing the concept or
            procedure. 2. Knowing the person and why the concept or
            procedure is important to them. 3. Writing to the person
            about the concept, given the complexities of both the
            concept and the person.</p>
            <p>I think the above points make technical communication a
            very interesting field. As a technical writer, you are
            constantly needing to think outside of yourself. Your job
            depends on other people needing to understand your writing,
            which usually requires you to bend and mold your writing to
            the language of the audience. This needs to be done in a way
            so that the conceptual and factual information still gets
            clearly communicated. This is a very unnatural thing to do.
            Very rarely do we see people able to communicate an idea in
            a way that is tailored to the people receiving it. Usually,
            people do the easier thing, which is to speak to people who
            don’t need you to translate terms or ideas into a language
            they can understand. Most people stick to groups that share
            commonalities with themselves. Why? It’s comfortable. It
            requires little effort to think about how someone similar to
            you will receive what you are communicating to them.</p>
            <p>On the other-hand, even though it is uncomfortable to
            communicate across groups, that act of uncomfortable
            communication produces a new connection. This is exactly
            what a technical writer does - they make connections between
            groups. In a way, tech writers create bridges. Their writing
            provides a medium for people of different groups to
            understand information otherwise foreign to them.</p>
            <p>There are more aspects of technical writing I want to dig
            into, but I will save that for a later date. I will continue
            to post blogs about tech writing, communication, tech
            writing tools, media, and other related topics. Hopefully my
            blog will have a subscribe feature where these posts can
            show up in your inbox whenever I post them. So, if you have
            read this far, stay tuned for updates!</p>
