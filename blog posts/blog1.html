        <h1>What is technical writing?</h1>
            <p>September 22, 2024</p>
            <p>What is technical communication? What is technical
            writing?</p>
            <p>I get these questions a lot, and so does probably every
            technical writer ever lived. The ‘go to’ answer sounds along
            the lines of ‘turning complex information into something
            understandable’or ’writing that helps others perform a
            task’, which are all true statements. But I don’t think
            those same statements honor these questions well.</p>
