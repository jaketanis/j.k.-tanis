        <h1>Learning to code in 2025</h1>
            <p>October 4th, 2025</p>
            <h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
            <p>I have been struggling to learn to code for a while now.</p>
            <p>Since 2019 really, I have been learning about software and coding. At that time, I was studying Animal Science at Texas A&amp;M University, hoping to get into medical school after graduating, but found myself interested in coding and programming. Conflicted about what to do after graduating, I decided technical writing was a good path because it blended my interests of tech and writing (the name says it all!).</p>
            <p>Before entering the masters program at the University of North Texas for tech writing, I took an intro computer science course at a local community college, and really liked it. At that time, I had already worked on some codeacademy tutorials for python, did some projects for a CS50 class, and attempted the intro computer science class at TAMU (I dropped it though; which I regret. I was worried it would ruin my GPA for med school).</p>
            <p>Learning about tech writing was super interesting and I really did enjoy it. It seemed to be a good career path for me. But, I always felt the urge to learn more about coding and programming. I was working at my church at the time while in the MA program, so my workload was pretty full.</p>
            <p>I have been employed as a tech writer for about 3 years now. I still find myself in the same situation. I want to learn more. This has morphed into learning more about API tech writing. API tech writing is a bridge between the tech writing and web dev world, so it seems natural. But if I’m honest with myself, I just want to learn more about software programming.</p>
            <p>I think this means a couple things for me moving forward.</p>
            <p>I will continue to work as a technical writer for as long as I know. I don’t see any reason to stop doing that.</p>
            <p>But, I will spend less of my free time working on technical writing projects. Instead, outside of spending time with family, friends, and with my church, I will work on learning more about web development. I have been playing with The Odin Project for a while, but never worked on the projects they talk about. I have consistently felt like learning more about coding and software development has been gnawing at me. I think I need to address it now.</p>
            <p>I love technical writing. I think it’s a great career, and will stay around to be relevent for most of my life, regardless of AI innovations. I hope now that my career can get supplemented by learning more about web development in my free time as I see fit.</p>
            <h2 id="coding-without-ai">Coding without AI</h2>
            <p>With that in mind, I have also made the decision not to use an AI LLM for learning more about web dev. I don’t see why I would. I honestly am not sure how well LLMs and AI help with learning. I have used it while developing my Flask app and other API documentation projects. I have used it to learn about certain concepts that are unknown to me. But something seems off still.</p>
            <p>I could be wrong, but I think the fact that an LLM has no ties to a person’s intentions on teaching and <strong>giving</strong> help to another person makes it not a great teacher. When googling something, or looking for something on youtube, a person made that happen (whether they used AI or not is besides the point; a person still intended to make that video/website/blog/etc).</p>
            <p>You could say that AI is bundling all of the worlds products on the internet (as in, a bundle of peoples intentional web products), and repackaging it into something digestible concerning the context of our prompts. True. But, something still seems off to me. I think I’d rather read a blog or official documentation. Maybe being a technical writer gives me another perspective here. <strong>A lot</strong> of thought goes into documentation. The team at my current company really cares about quality work. I think that has an effect that goes beyond what any LLM can produce. It suggests that the intention behind the guiding information is more relational rather than convienent.</p>
            <p>Those are my latest thoughts on AI. They could change. I think AI can be used in some good ways. But, I don’t think it can replace the relational element of someone teaching another person something. That is unique and valuable.</p>
