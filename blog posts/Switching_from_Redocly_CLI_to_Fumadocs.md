title: Switching from Redocly CLI to Fumadocs

I recently created a simple CRUD web app called Ennoia. It's a book reflection app where you can write down your thoughts about the book and save it to your collection. It was a good way for me to learn about web development, and I also use it as well. 

I created an API for the app that gets saved book data. Right now, it only gets data for one book or all books. I also documemnted the API with Redocly CLI.

This was my first real API doocumentation project.
